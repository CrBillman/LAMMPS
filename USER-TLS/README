This package contains compute hessian and compute freq commands to
output the hessian matrix (hessian) or its eigenvalues and
eigenvectors (freq).  Also includes couple_elastic command to 
calculate the elastic and coupling constants for configurations
making up a two-level-system (amorphous oxides).

To use, type 'make-user-tls' from the src directory.  Then, make
lammps as you normally would for your system.

The person who created this package is Jonathan Trinastic
(jptrinastic at gmail dot com) at the University of Florida. Contact
him directly if you have questions.
